Relational Databases		
		Why do we need database
			File storage will difficult to maitaina
			sharing of the data would be difficult
			it is not centralized
			Searching and adding the data would be difficult
			if you wanted to do analysis on the data would be difficult
		What are databases nedded
			Engine
			  Which can answer your queries using SQL
			  


Microsoft SQL Server
	Relational Database: RDBMS
	
	Database Engine	
	Analysis Service
	Integration Service
	
	
			  
SQL >> RDBMS >> MSSQL >> Database Engine
